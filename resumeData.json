I prefer holding greater responsibilities with consideration of the environment and psychological health of the team. In a working environment, I work better in an open non-clustered workspace or in a room with a group or alone. As for working locations, I am able to work overseas though I prefer to work remotely from the comfort of my own home. Socialising with clients is not an issue for me as I have much experience in doing so, and this includes requirement gathering, analysing, designing, and developing solutions to problems, all in the result of translating requirements into functional programming.",
